Little Steps, Big Growth: Whole Family Coaching
This project is being created as my final project for MSSE 661 Web Software Development
Regis University

The purpose of this website is to offer resources and services to parents and families who desire support and coaching on improving relationships within the family. There are many different events and situations in life that may be difficult to navigate. Little Steps, Big Growth is here to guide and support your whole family through these hard to navigate situations.

## Project Structure Update (August 2025)
All static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are now located in `Parenting-Coach/public`.
The Express server in the root (`index.js`) serves files from this unified location for seamless operation.
Duplicate files in the root directory have been removed for clarity and maintainability.

Features of the website:

    My account page with secure login
    List of offered resources and services
    Upcoming events page with the ability to register for events
    Easy to follow layout

Languages and plugins used:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    NodeJS
    Express
    MySQL

As I have worked on develpment of this project, the name of the website has changed from "The Parenting Coach" to "Little Steps, Big Growth: Whole Family Coaching". This change feels like it better represents the purpose of this project and the services and resources that will be provided.
